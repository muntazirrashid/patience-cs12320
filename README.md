# patience-cs12320

# Problem Statement:
My friend Chris developed a form of patience (solitaire) card game that I would like to be able to play on my computer. It is very simple, runs from command line but has a basic graphical interface.
This is how it works:
• The object of the game is to end up with one pile/stack of cards.
• Shuffle a deck of cards. • Lay down the first card face up.
• Lay down the next one next to it, and so on.
• This would lead you to 52 cards all facing upwards, except that you can put one pile
on another if any of the following apply:
o They are next to each other and the same number or suit.
o There are two piles between them, and they are the same number or suit.
# Game:
The game can be played using either the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI lists down a menu of different commands by which you can play the game, and GUI is the graphical representation of the game and is fully responsive to mouse clicks.
There is also a Rule/Help Section (Pop-up) in the GUI of the game which reminds the player of the rules and also has a button there which automatically makes a move for the user. When the user is done playing the game, an ‘Exit’ button appears on the screen, which can be used to close the game. An exit option is also present in the CLI menu of the game. Before the actual game, there is a menu which has two options: Start and Exit, by which you can start or exit the game. Both of these options are present on the CLI as well as the GUI of the game.
